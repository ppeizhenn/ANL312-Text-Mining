# Text Mining - Topic Modelling using R
Flashup, an e-commerce women fashion startup, aims to enhance its reputation branding by identifying areas of improvement and customer needs. They use topic modelling, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to identify underlying themes or subjects that define a collection of documents. It uses a bag of words model that focuses on term frequency and co-occurrences within individual documents, thereby ignoring word order and document context (Murel & Kavlakoglu, 2024). 


Flashup can apply topic modelling on the reviews left by past customers to uncover topics which are represented by a list of keywords, thereby divulging major areas of improvements to focus on. Although the algorithm can assist us in identifying themes in a vast collection of documents, it is ultimately up to the user to give the created subjects meaningful titles that can offer valuable insights into the primary business issue (Zhang, 2024).
